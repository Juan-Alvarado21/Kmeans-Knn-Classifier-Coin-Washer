# Knn Classifier and Edge Recognition-Based Segmentation Using K-means

## Overview

This project, **Knn Classifier and Edge Recognition-Based Segmentation Using K-means**, is an implementation in **C++** focused on applying machine learning techniques to image classification. Specifically, the project aims to classify images of washers and coins—two objects with similar circular shapes—by combining several key algorithms:

- **K-nearest neighbors (Knn) classifier**
- **K-means clustering** for image segmentation
- **Sobel filters** for edge detection
- **Hu moments** for shape analysis

By integrating these methods, the algorithm effectively distinguishes between geometrically similar objects, providing a solution for challenges commonly encountered in industrial sorting systems that require precise object recognition.

## Key Features

- **Knn classifier**: For image-based object classification
- **K-means segmentation**: For partitioning images based on features
- **Sobel edge detection**: For identifying edges in the images
- **Hu moments**: For analyzing shapes and improving classification
- **C++**: Implemented entirely from scratch in C++

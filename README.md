# Knn Classifier and Edge Recognition-Based Segmentation Using K-means

## Overview

This project, **Knn Classifier and Edge Recognition-Based Segmentation Using K-means**, is an implementation in **C++** focused on applying machine learning techniques to image classification. Specifically, the project aims to classify images of washers and coins—two objects with similar circular shapes—by combining several key algorithms:

- **K-nearest neighbors (Knn) classifier**
- **K-means clustering** for image segmentation
- **Sobel filters** for edge detection
- **Hu moments** for shape analysis

By integrating these methods, the algorithm effectively distinguishes between geometrically similar objects, providing a solution for challenges commonly encountered in industrial sorting systems that require precise object recognition.

## Key Features

- **Knn classifier**: For image-based object classification
- **K-means segmentation**: For partitioning images based on features
- **Sobel edge detection**: For identifying edges in the images
- **Hu moments**: For analyzing shapes and improving classification
- **C++**: Implemented entirely from scratch in C++

## Images

Here are some sample images used in the project:

Original images:
- ![Original Image 1](img/116.ppm)
- ![Original Image 2](img/lllll.ppm)

Processed samples:
- ![Processed Sample 1](salida_p1.ppm)
- ![Processed Sample 2](salida_p2.ppm)

## Dataset

Please note that the dataset used in this project is **not included** in the repository because it is too large to be hosted here. If you'd like to experiment with the project, please prepare your own dataset or contact the author for more details on how to access the original dataset.

# Kmeans-Knn-Classifier-Coin-Washer
This C++ from-scratch project implements a machine learning system to classify images of washers and coins using the K-nearest neighbors (Knn) classifier and K-means clustering for segmentation. The system incorporates Sobel edge detection and Hu moments for shape analysis, allowing it to accurately distinguish between similar circular objects.
